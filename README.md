### In this project, I built a machine learning–based sales prediction system using the BigMart sales dataset.
The aim of the project is to predict product sales across different BigMart outlets by learning patterns from historical data.

I implemented the complete workflow in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, and trained the model using XGBRegressor (XGBoost) for accurate regression performance.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

Analyze historical BigMart sales data

Handle both numerical and categorical features

Train a robust regression model

Predict outlet-wise product sales with good accuracy

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset Name: BigMart Sales Dataset

File: bigmart.csv

### The dataset contains information related to both products and outlets, including:

Item type

Item MRP

Item visibility

Outlet size

Outlet location type

Outlet establishment year

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Problem Type: Regression

Model Used: XGBRegressor (XGBoost)

### I chose XGBoost because it:

Handles non-linear relationships effectively

Performs well on structured/tabular data

Provides strong predictive performance for regression tasks

## ⚙️ Workflow / ML Pipeline

### In this project, I followed these steps:

Loaded and explored the dataset

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Performed feature preparation

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained the model using XGBRegressor

Evaluated model performance using R² score

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluation Metric: R² Score

The trained XGBRegressor achieved a good R² score, indicating that the model explains a significant portion of variance in sales values.
